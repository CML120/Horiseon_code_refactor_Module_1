# Horiseon_code_refactor_Module_1

Module 1: refactor html for accessibility  
The purpose of this project is to update the Horiseon web page with semantic html.  
This will improve user accessibility, readability in programming, and search engine optimization (SEO).

## User Story
AS A marketing agency  
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
